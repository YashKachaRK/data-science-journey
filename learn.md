Awesome! Here’s a clear step-by-step roadmap you can follow. Assume ~6–8 hrs/week. Each week ends with a small deliverable so you build a portfolio as you learn.

0) Setup (1 day)

Install Python 3.11+, VS Code, Jupyter (or Anaconda), Git.

Create a GitHub repo: data-science-journey.

Make a /data and /notebooks folder.
Deliverable: README with goals + tool versions.

Weeks 1–12 (Beginner → Job-ready basics)
Week 1 — Python Basics

Syntax, variables, lists/tuples/dicts, loops, functions, file I/O.

Practice: 20 short exercises (strings, lists, dicts).
Deliverable: notebooks/01_python_basics.ipynb with solutions.

Week 2 — NumPy & Pandas I (Core)

NumPy arrays, shapes, indexing, vectorization.

Pandas: Series/DataFrame, read CSV, filter, sort, groupby, merge.
Deliverable: Mini-EDA on a CSV (e.g., sales or Titanic): 10 insights.

Week 3 — Visualization & EDA

Matplotlib & Seaborn: hist, box, bar, line, scatter, pairplot, heatmap.

EDA workflow: questions → visuals → insights → next steps.
Deliverable: EDA notebook with 6–8 plots + narrative.

Week 4 — Statistics for DS

Descriptive stats, probability, common distributions.

Hypothesis testing (t-test/chi-square), p-values, confidence intervals.
Deliverable: A/B test case study (fake or public data) with conclusion.

Week 5 — SQL Fundamentals

SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING, JOINS.

Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK), basic CTEs.
Deliverable: 10 SQL queries + answers in a .sql file or notebook.

Week 6 — ML Intro: Supervised Learning

ML mindset: problem framing, baseline, train/test split.

Linear & Logistic Regression, metrics (MAE/RMSE, accuracy, ROC-AUC).
Deliverable: Titanic (classification) or House Prices (regression) baseline models.

Week 7 — Trees & Ensembles

Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM).

Feature importance, overfitting, cross-validation.
Deliverable: Improve Week-6 project with an ensemble and CV.

Week 8 — Unsupervised Learning & Dimensionality Reduction

K-Means, Hierarchical clustering, PCA.

Use cases: customer segments, anomaly hints, visualization in 2D.
Deliverable: Customer segmentation notebook + 2 cluster visuals.

Week 9 — Pipelines & Preprocessing

Imputation, scaling, encoding, column transformers.

Scikit-learn Pipelines, GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV.
Deliverable: Rebuild a previous model end-to-end with a pipeline + tuned params.

Week 10 — End-to-End Project (Pick a Domain)

Choose a dataset (retail, finance, healthcare, sports, or your own).

Steps: Problem → EDA → Features → Model(s) → Evaluation → Limitations.
Deliverable: Complete project notebook + clear README.

Week 11 — Communicating Insights

Data storytelling; tidy charts; avoid chartjunk.

Optional: simple dashboard (Streamlit/Plotly) or a compact slide deck.
Deliverable: 5–8 slide summary or a minimal Streamlit app.

Week 12 — Portfolio Polish & Interview Prep

Clean repo structure, add READMEs, environment file, and project summaries.

Practice: explain one project in 2–3 minutes, write 3 resume bullets.
Deliverable: Portfolio ready GitHub; one polished project pinned.

After 12 Weeks (Months 4–6: Depth, optional)

Advanced ML: XGBoost tuning, class imbalance, calibration.

Deep Learning: PyTorch or TensorFlow; CNNs (images), basic NLP (Bag-of-Words → Transformers intro).

MLOps basics: model versioning, Docker, simple CI/CD, monitoring.

Cloud: one provider (AWS/GCP/Azure) to deploy a small app.

Weekly Study Pattern (repeatable)

Learn (2–3h): watch/read + take notes.

Code (2–3h): reproduce examples without copy-pasting.

Apply (2h): mini-project/dataset.

Reflect (30m): write 5–10 lines of what you learned + next steps.

Suggested Starter Datasets

Titanic, Iris, California Housing, NYC Taxi, Retail Sales.

Pick domains you like (e.g., sports stats, finance candles, health metrics).

What to Install (quick list)

python, jupyter, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost (later), streamlit (optional).
